## Introduction

Cervical cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment and improved outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the UCI Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset, identifying patterns and risk factors that contribute to cervical cancer. By providing predictive insights, the project aims to support healthcare professionals and researchers in combating this disease.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29)
- **Description**: The dataset includes demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors for cervical cancer, collected from 858 instances.
- **Attributes**: 36 features, including:
  - Demographic information (age, number of pregnancies, etc.)
  - Behavioral factors (smoking, contraceptive use, etc.)
  - Medical history (STDs, previous cancer diagnosis, etc.)
  - Target variable: Biopsy results indicating cancer presence.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. Analyze the dataset to understand the key risk factors associated with cervical cancer.
2. Build a predictive model to estimate cervical cancer risk based on input features.

### Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: Assess data quality, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform features for better model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Apply machine learning algorithms to build classification models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Visualization**: Data visualizations to illustrate findings and model results.
