## Introduction

Cervical cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection is critical for effective treatment and improved outcomes. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze the UCI Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset, identifying patterns and risk factors that contribute to cervical cancer. By providing predictive insights, the project aims to support healthcare professionals and researchers in combating this disease.
